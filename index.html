    <h1>Hello, welcome to Nolan Delapaz Nguyen's personal site! This is a work-in-progress.</h1>
    <p>I am currently taking some time to learn HTML and CSS to build it the way I want to. 
    When I'm done, it'll serve as a central hub for all of my creative and compsci projects.
    <br>But, for the time being, please bear with my CSS-less front page and take a look around!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nolan Nguyen, and I am a second-year computer science student currently attending Loyola Marymount University.</p>
