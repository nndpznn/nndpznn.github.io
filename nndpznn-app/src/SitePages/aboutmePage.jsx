        Hi! My name is Nolan - I'm a sophomore computer science major and
        business minor currently attending Loyola Marymount University.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I was born and raised in the SF Bay Area. I grew up with a
        camera in my hands and learned to express myself creatively through
        photo and video. <br></br>
        <br></br> Computer science was a later development, but soon grew to be
        one of my central interests — I'm constantly inspired by the
        possibilities and am always looking to pick up skills. So far, I've
        taken a liking to front-end web development, but I'm leaving the door
        open for more... <br></br>
        <br></br> I'm very active on all my listed platforms. Feel free to reach
        out if you have anything cool to share, or if you just want to chat :)
      </p>
