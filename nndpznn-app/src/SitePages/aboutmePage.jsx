          Hey there! My name is Nolan Nguyen. I'm currently a senior Computer Science major and Business Administration minor at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. I hail from a tiny tucked-away town in the Bay Area named Alameda.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          I grew up with a camera in my hands and learned to express myself through photo and video. Both are extremely personal creative processes that I could never get sick of. I came across computer science through that same desire to create, and so far have found no limits to speak of :)
          <br></br>
          <br></br>

          I've built frontend with React, Svelte and SwiftUI, neural networks with PyTorch, a baby graphics engine with ThreeJS, even a Discord bot that sends me basketball stats.
          
          Keep an eye on my Github for more!
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Please reach out with any opportunities to share, or if you'd like to chat more about my experiences and the things I can offer. I hope to hear from you soon!
