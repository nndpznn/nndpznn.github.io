          <p className="text-2xl mx-5">I was a Software Development Engineer intern at AWS this past summer. My project was to build a new CloudWatch diagnostic tool, which was an LLM-powered agent designed to analyze CloudWatch Logs and perform root-cause analysis for human developers. I began with a proof of concept and throughout the course of the internship I improved its precision and accuracy in determining the root cause as well as its latency. By the end of my time there it was in a deployable state to the Gamma stage.
          <br></br><br></br>
          My time here has been the most I've been challenged as an engineer and employee so far. Having to take ownership of a software component end-to-end and defend my design decisions in front of senior engineers was a new challenge for me and required me to be at the top of my game and become the subject matter expert on my project. <br></br><br></br> Technologies used: Java, LangChain4j, AWS CloudWatch & Lambda.</p>
