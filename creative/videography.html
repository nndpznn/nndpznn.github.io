    <h1>Videography</h1>
    <p>Since middle school, videography has been my primary creative outlet, enabling me to store and present my most precious memories
        to others, as well as land me opportunities to work and develop my skills at my current position as <strong>Video Coordinator</strong> at the Los Angeles Loyolan. </p>

    <h2>My time at the Loyolan</h2>

    <p><em>The Los Angeles Loyolan is a student-run, digital publication serving communities in the LMU and Westchester area.</em></p>

    <br>
    <p>Throughout my time at the Loyolan, I have been met with nothing but kindness and encouragement to improve as not only a videographer, but also as a team member and leader.
        The projects I've been involved in since being hired have allowed me to explore the college experience and get familiar with all kinds of people, as well as create actual 
        change through the impact the Loyolan has on the LMU community.

    <p>The kinds of videos I post on my personal channel are the reason I started making videos in the first place. While I do have a lot of fun making them, I still strive
         to improve some part of my technique or writing every time. </p>
