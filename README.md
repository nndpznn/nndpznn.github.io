# Welcome to nndpznn.github.io!

Moving forward, this will be my central spot to share and document all of my projects, in computer science, videography, and all else. This is, in and of itself, a project! I hope to watch this site evolve and grow over the years as I do so myself.

## Future content?
- A blog-style page with project updates, with the end goal of connecting all of my platforms like Youtube, Github, etc.
- Projects section of CompSci page
- Skills section of CompSci page

## Credits/Special Thanks

### Programming the navigation bar
- Thank you to Web Dev Simplified on Youtube, and plenty, plenty of StackOverflow searches.
