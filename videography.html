    <h1>Videography</h1>
    <p>Since middle school, videography has been my primary creative outlet, enabling me to store and present my most precious memories
        to others, as well as land me opportunities to work and develop my skills at my current position as <strong>Video Coordinator</strong> at the Los Angeles Loyolan. </p>

    <h2>My Time at the Loyolan</h2>

    <p>Throughout my time at the Loyolan, I have been met with nothing but kindness and encouragement to improve as not only a videographer, but also as a team member and leader.</p>
